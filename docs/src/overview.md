# Overview

`task.sh` turns natural language into vetted shell commands. It targets Linux, macOS, and Windows users who need a quick, explainable command suggestion engine backed by OpenAI models.

- **Safety-first**: Commands are filtered with heuristics to avoid destructive actions.
- **Explainable**: Verbose mode surfaces raw AI output and clarifies intent.
- **Extensible**: Plug into different shells (`bash`, `zsh`) and wire additional validators.
